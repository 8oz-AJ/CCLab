                <p>This is part of the story telling of your project. Add the relevant information for the creature you

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Physarums usually live alone until mating season starts which is around spring and is considered an adult from 
                    birth. The creature itself does not age and can only die when a natural predator kills it. It lives in a dark and
                     humid environment so when thunderstorms happen they are ready to collect the energy leftover by lightning strikes.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>What we know so far is that they are green mostly and yellow during mating season. They multiply based on the amount they consume and they are still an enigmatic creature.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Moves randomly</li>
                    <li>Only moves when lightning strikes</li>
                    <li>Never alone</li>
                    <li>No organs so far</li>
                </ul>

                The Physarum, resembling the famous superhero movie “Venom,” is almost like a symbiotic creature. From the outside, it appears as a fungus, with colors ranging from yellow to green. Its ability to stretch or multiply depends on its food and survival needs.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> DO NOT TOUCH THEM AND RUN ON SITE. Due to the high amount of energy they consume from lightning strikes the human skin will burn on contact.
